# Algorithm for Walking Motion

1. Initialization
   - Define the robotâ€™s body structure (e.g., joints and motors).
   - Set up the motors for the legs (e.g., hip, knee, and ankle servos).

2. Lift the First Leg
   - Activate the hip joint to lift the first leg.
   - Bend the knee to bring the foot off the ground.
   - Adjust the ankle to position the foot for the step.

3. Move the First Leg Forward
   - Move the lifted foot forward.
   - Ensure the movement path is smooth and aligns with the body.

4. Place the Foot Down
   - Straighten the knee and ankle to place the foot securely on the ground.
   - Adjust the hip joint to ensure the body stays balanced.

5. Lift the Other Leg
   - Repeat steps 2-4 for the other leg.
   - Ensure that the body remains stable as weight shifts to the other foot.

6. Rebalance
   - If necessary, use the core or balance control algorithms to ensure the robot stays upright as the legs alternate.
   - Adjust the torso and arms (if needed) to keep the robot balanced.

7. Repeat
   - Continuously alternate the steps for each leg until the desired walking pattern is achieved (e.g., a smooth, steady gait).

8. End of Step
   - If the robot reaches the destination or completes the task, stop the walking motion.
